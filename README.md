Simple weather app built using Swift 4.2. Displays forecasted high, forecasted low, and current temperature at user's current location.

Uses Unsplash API to set background according to current weather conditions.

Still TODO:
- Fix URWeatherKit integration
- Make onscreen text contrast from background automataically
- Add daily notification
