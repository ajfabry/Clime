# Clime

Simple weather app built using Swift 4.2. Displays forecasted high, forecasted low, and current temperature at user's current location.

Still TODO:
- Sync animated effects with current weather conditions
- Sync recommended accessories (e.g. umbrella, jacket) with current weather conditions
